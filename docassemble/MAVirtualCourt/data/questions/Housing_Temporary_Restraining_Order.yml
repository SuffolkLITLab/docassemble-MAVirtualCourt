  #### What is a breach of quiet enjoyment?
  A breach of quiet enjoyment is something that your landlord did or should
  have done that makes your home unlivable. This can cover a lot of different
  issues. The problem needs to be serious and you can get help for issues
  that the court agrees are emergencies with this form.
  
  Examples might include:
  
  * A sewage backup in your basement
  * A strong unpleasant odor
  * Constant noise at unreasonable times of day (remember, even if you are
  working from home, permitted construction may still be allowed)
  * Unsafe living conditions that your landlord isn't fixing

      If you do not have a phone number or email the court can use, provide
      specific contact instructions. For example, use a friend's phone number.
      But the friend must be someone you can trust to tell you the court is
      trying to reach you.

help: |
  You _must_ provide contact information so the court can reach you.
  
  Some forms allow you to tell the court you need to keep your address, phone,
  and email confidential, so that only court staff can see this information.
