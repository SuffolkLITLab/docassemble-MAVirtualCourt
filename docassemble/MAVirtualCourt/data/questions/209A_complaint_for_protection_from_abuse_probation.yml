  You can ask the court to:
  
  * Give you temporary custody of the children you have in common with ${other_parties.familiar()}.
  * Order ${other_parties.familiar()} to have no contact with your ${children.as_noun()}.
  * Make orders about when, where and how ${other_parties.familiar()} can spend time or have contact with your ${children.as_noun()}.
  * Order ${other_parties.familiar()} to stay away from schools, daycare or other places your ${children.as_noun()} might go.
  * Order ${other_parties.familiar()} to pay child support for the children.
  * Order anything else you need to keep your ${children.as_noun()} safe.

  The next questions ask if you need any of these orders, one at a time.

  label: What is "temporary custody"?
  heading: Temporary custody?
  content: |
    A temporary custody order is supposed to be short-term until the court makes a final decision, but often temporary orders end up being permanent.
    
    When you ask the court for a 209A order, remember you will be coming back for a hearing in 10 days. So at this first hearing, you can ask the judge to give you custody of your ${children.as_noun()} at least until the 10 day hearing.   

    At the 10 day hearing, ${other_parties.familiar()} can try to convince the judge to change the order.

  Before you ask the judge to order Visitation
subquestion: |
  If your ${children.as_noun()} need to spend time with ${other_parties.familiar()}, they need to be safe and you need to be safe. 

  You can ask the District Court, Boston Municipal Court (BMC) and Superior Court to order only safe ways ${other_parties.familiar()} can spend time with your children. Or, you can ask the Probate and Family Court for “visitation.”

  **District Court, BMC or Superior Court**
 
  If you ask the District Court, BMC or Superior Court for a restraining order, you can ask the judge to order that:
 
  1. You have custody of your children, and 
  2. ${other_parties.familiar()} has contact with your children **only** in ways that are safe. You can be detailed about safe ways for them to spend time together. Or
  3.  You can ask the judge to order ${other_parties.familiar()} to have no contact with your children.

  **Probate and Family Court**
  
  The  Probate and Family Court is the only court that can order visitation. If you ask the Probate and Family Court for a restraining order:
 
  1. The judge will probably ask you about visitation.
  2. You will have to explain why the visitation you are asking for is necessary.
  3. You must follow the visitation order you get. Visitation orders are not flexible.
  4. When you go back to court for the 10-day hearing, ${other_parties.familiar()} will have a chance to give their opinion and they may bring up visitation. You will have to explain again why you need the order you ask for.
  
   ${other_parties.familiar()} may take you to court again and again to try to change the order.
 
  If you do not follow the order **exactly** as it is written, you will be in contempt of court.

  What do you need in the visitation order?
subquestion: |
  Think about the visitation schedule you need. Write it down and be prepared to explain to the court why this schedule works for you and your children. 
 
  Think about if supervised visitation may be the best option for your ${children.as_noun()}. Keep in mind that the judge **will** take ${other_parties.familiar()}'s view into account as well. And the judge may not order exactly what you ask for.
  
  Is [supervised visitation](https://www.masslegalhelp.org/domestic-violence/supervised-visitation) the best option for you?

id: child support
question: |
  Before you ask the judge to order child support
subquestion: |
  Think carefully about asking for child support in the 209A order. 
  
  Only you know how safe it is to ask the court to order ${other_parties.familiar()} to pay you anything. 

  If ${other_parties.familiar()} is angry about paying child support, ${other_parties.familiar()} may be more likely to threaten you or hurt you, **or** take you to court to ask for custody, parenting time, or to make decisions about your ${children.as_noun()}'s life. 

  It may be worth it to get a child support order. All parents should support their children. But if you believe that asking for child support is dangerous, you might be better off not asking for it. Child support might not be worth risking your health and safety, or the health and safety of your ${children.as_noun()}. 
  
  You can always talk with a domestic violence advocate for help. [Safelink](https://www.casamyrna.org/get-support/safelink): ${tel("1-877-785-2020")}
  Learn more: Read [Is filing for child support safe?](https://www.masslegalhelp.org/domestic-violence/child-support/is-filing-safe) on MassLegalHelp.org
    
  **Note:** The judge will not order ${other_parties.familiar()} to pay you anything until the 10 day hearing. At that hearing ${other_parties.familiar()} will know you have a restraining order and if you have asked for child support, ${other_parties.familiar()} will know that also.

  This question is asked iff there are no cases of the "paternity" case_status.
  This could happen if defendant was adjudicated NOT to be the father, so not a joint child
  and thus case not disclosed on affidavit of care or custody.
