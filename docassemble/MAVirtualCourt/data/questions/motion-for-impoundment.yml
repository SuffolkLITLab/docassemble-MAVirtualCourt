question:
  Keeping your information private - Motion for Impoundment
subquestion: |
  If you need to keep anything you have told the court from people who normally can see it, you have the right to ask the court to "impound" information.
  
  You must explain why it is important to keep this information private. Your reasons must be more than simply to protect your privacy. You must show that you need the court to keep the information private so nobody can use it to harm you.

  The next section asks about information you can keep private. If you decide to ask the court to keep information private, your court forms will include a "Motion for Impoundment."

  % endif
  your contact information, that goes on the Plaintiff Confidential Information form: your address, phone numbers, email and the best way to reach you. 

  The rest of the forms you file are public record.
  % endif  
  
  You can ask the court to impound your other forms to keep other information in your forms private. You need to explain why it is critical to your safety to keep this information private.

Comment: |
  At this point we already know if plaintiff has asked court to order defendant to stay away from any addresses. So this question should be more intelligent. 
  Pursuant to G.L. c. 209A, § 8 or G.L. c. 258E, § 10 - not needed.
id: impound contact info
question: |
  Keep private -  information about how to contact you
subquestion: |
  You can ask the court to keep your addresses from police and court staff who normally would be able to see this information. You can ask the court to keep private your:

  * home address, where you are living right now
  % if not order_defendant_remain_away_plaintiff_workplace_yes:
  ,
  * work address
  % endif
  % if not order_defendant_remain_away_plaintiff_school_yes:
  ,
  * school address
  % endif,  and
  * telephone numbers.
  
  The Court can keep your address from ${other_parties.familiar()} even if the judge orders ${other_parties.familiar()} to stay away from that address. Your restraining order will order ${other_parties.familiar()} to stay away from your address, "wherever that may be."

  Do you need to keep your addresses and phone numbers private?
yesno: impound_personal_information
help: 
  label: "What is 'confidential' then?"
  heading: "Isn't this already supposed to be confidential?"
  content: |
    Your home, school and work addresses: 

    * are automatically kept from the public.
    * are automatically kept from ${ other_parties.familiar() } and
    ${ other_parties.familiar() }’s lawyer and 
    * will be available to you, your lawyer, people you give the court permission to show, and to certain persons who may need this information so they can do their job. These are prosecutors, law enforcement officers, victim-witness advocates, sexual assault counselors and domestic violence counselors.
    
    If you asked the court to order  ${ other_parties.familiar() } to stay away from your home, work or school, the order will say ${ other_parties.familiar() } must stay away from your home, work or school, "wherever that may be."
    
    If you need the court not to share this information with people who normally see the information to do their jobs, you may ask the judge to issue an Order of Impoundment. 
    
    Normally, everything in your complaint **except** your address, phone and email information is public. You may ask the judge to impound this other information from the public also. But you need to explain to the judge why your safety depends on impounding this other information. Your need for privacy is not a good enough reason for a judge to decide to impound court records. 
    
    If you ask the judge to impound information with **no notice** to ${ other_parties.familiar()} or any other interested persons, you must explain why giving notice would put you at risk of immediate harm that you would not be able to recover from.

id: why impound
question: |
  Why do you need the court to impound your information?
subquestion: |  
  Privacy alone is usually not enough. Good reasons for impounding include the
  information is very sensitive, such as involving sexual assault, or could be
  very damaging to you or your children, or could be used for reasons that could harm you or your children.

  Be specific. Include facts about your safety.

question: |
  Getting an impoundment order with no notice to ${other_parties.familiar()}
subquestion: |
  You can ask the judge to impound your information with no notice to ${other_parties.familiar()} if you can show the judge you will suffer "immediate and irreparable harm" if the court lets ${other_parties.familiar()} know about this request in advance.

  If you do not need the judge to impound the information **before** the court tells ${other_parties.familiar()}, uncheck the box below.
