  Update this if our interview needs to handle more types of people
  This is mostly used for signature flow
  
  You can also add more people in your interview if you need them.
  Use .append() on this list.

  You have the right to an interpreter.

  * You may not understand **everything** that is said in English. Or
  * Other people in the hearing will not be able to understand you. 
  
  Then ask.
  
  You do not have to speak only through the interpeter, but you will have one if you need one.
