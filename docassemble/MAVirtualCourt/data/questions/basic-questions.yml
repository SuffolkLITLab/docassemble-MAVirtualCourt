  This question is asked if the interview can be used by both
  a Plaintiff and a Defendant. It sets the value of `user_role`,
  `plaintiffs`, `defendants`, `petitioners` and `respondents`.
  
  If you know your interview is exclusively
  used by the Plaintiff or Defendant, set `user_role = 'plaintiff'` or 
  `user_role='defendant'` in your code.

    How do I pick a court?
  content: |
    For some cases, you can choose your court.
    % if user_role=='plaintiff':    
    How do you know which court to choose?
  
    Massachusetts has 7 trial court departments:
    
    * District Court
    * Boston Municipal Court (BMC)
    * Superior Court
    * Probate and Family Court
    * Juvenile Court
    * Housing Court
    * Land Court
    
    The District Court, BMC, and Superior Court are all courts that can hear
    any type of case. Housing, Probate and Family and Juvenile Court are
     **specialist** courts that hear one kind of case.
    They have judges with special training as well as special 
    resources available.
    
    Different courts can make different kinds of decisions. Not every court
    can give you every kind of help. For example, you can only
    ask for visitation in the Probate and Family Court. Only
    the Housing Court or Superior Court can hear discrimination
    cases.
    
    Depending on where you live, different courts may be further or closer to
    your address. There are about 100 district courts all over the state,
    but each county has only one or a few Superior Courts or specialty
    courts.
    
    Choosing a court means thinking about what kind of help you need, as well
    as which court you can get transportation to on the day of your hearing.
    
    Only you know the right choice.
    
    You can also view the court selection guidance at [mass.gov](https://www.mass.gov/courthouse-locator).
    % else:
    If you are responding to a case someone else filed, you may not
    get to choose your court. Select the court that is already
    listed on your court paperwork.

    * Superior Court
    * Probate and Family Court
    * Juvenile Court
    * Housing Court
    * Land Court
    
    The District Court, BMC, and Superior Court are all courts that can hear
    any type of case. Housing, Probate and Family and Juvenile Court are
     **specialist** courts that hear one kind of case.
    They have judges with special training as well as special 
    resources available.
    
    Different courts can make different kinds of decisions. Not every court
    can give you every kind of help. For example, you can only
    ask for visitation in the Probate and Family Court. Only
    the Housing Court or Superior Court can hear discrimination
    cases.
    
    Depending on where you live, different courts may be further or closer to
    your address. There are about 100 district courts all over the state,
    but each county has only one or a few Superior Courts or specialty
    courts.
    
    Choosing a court means thinking about what kind of help you need, as well
    as which court you can get transportation to on the day of your hearing.
    
    Only you know the right choice.
    
    You can also view the court selection guidance at [mass.gov](https://www.mass.gov/courthouse-locator).
    % else:
    If you are responding to a case someone else filed, you may not
    get to choose your court. Select the court that is already
    listed on your court paperwork.
