question: |
  What to expect.
subquestion: |
  When you ask the court for an abuse prevention order, the judge can do three things.

  1.  Deny your request. Refuse to give you a restraining order.  The Defendant will not get any notice that you asked the court for a restraining order.

  2. Make a temporary order. The judge will decide what you need to protect you from  the Defendant until the 2nd hearing.  
  The judge will not order  the Defendant  to pay support or other money at this 1st hearing.  
  The 2nd hearing will be within 10 days of the temporary order. At the 2nd hearing the judge can hear from both you and the Defendant  at the same time.

  3.  Not make any order until they can hear from both you and the Defendant at the same time.  The judge may decide not to make an order at the first hearing if they think you will be safe from  "immediate danger of abuse" from  the Defendant.  If the judge decides not to make an order and you decide to go to a hearing where the judge can hear from both of you,  the Defendant will find out you have asked for a restraining order.
  
  Please contact a domestic violence advocate at (877) 785-2020 if you want to talk to someone more about what to expect in this process.

  We are sorry, you should complete this interview with an advocate.
subquestion: |
  Unfortunately, this tool is not currently available to plaintiffs under 18 filing unless they are filing with a parent or guardian.  You may still be able to file directly by calling your local courthouse or police station when the courts are closed, but it could be complicated.
under: |
  Since you are under 18, the Department of Children and Families may get involved if you file a restraining order. You can read more about getting a restraining order while you are under 18 at https://www.masslegalhelp.org/domestic-violence/abuse-prevention-orders/under-18.  You can also contact a 24/7 domestic violence hotline at (877) 785-2020 to talk to someone about what's going on.  # Someone at Children's Law Center is getting me some additional child appropriate resources here.
