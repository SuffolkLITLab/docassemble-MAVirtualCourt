  209A Affidavit
subquestion: |
  The judge needs to understand why you need a 209A order.
  
  The next few questions will be used to fill in the "209A Affidavit".

  Use the Affidavit form to describe the abuse. The affidavit needs to be in the words
  of the person who is being protected.
   
  When you sign your name you are declaring, "under penalty of perjury" that what you wrote is true to the best of your knowledge.
terms:
  under penalty of perjury: |
    It means that you are swearing that what you wrote is true as far as you know. Swearing "under penalty of perjury" means the court can punish you if what you write is not true to the best of your knowledge.
    You cannot be punished if what you wrote is what you saw, heard, or felt.
    You cannot be punished if you had good reason to believe that what you wrote is true. 
  true to the best of your knowledge: |
    Something is true "to the best of your knowledge" if you were there and saw, heard, or felt it. Something is true to the best of your knowledge if you have a good reason to believe it is true.

  Ready? Most recent abuse
subquestion: |
  Tell the judge about the most recent abuse first. 
   
  Then tell the judge about other serious incidents, if there are any. 
   
  When you are ready, press "Next".
help:
  label: What should I talk about?
  heading: Is this all?
  content: |
    Tell the judge about any incidents where you or a child were physically harmed, threatened, felt fear, or tried to get help from police. Judges often care most about abuse that has happened during the last year. One serious incident can be enough to get an Order for Protection. But adding more incidents may improve your chances -- especially if you can show a pattern or trend of abuse. Make it very clear to the judge that you need help.

    2 examples to help you understand how to write a good description: 
    
    **A poor example:** 
    
    We were arguing. ${ defendant } screamed at me and I was afraid. 
    
    **A good example:** 
    
    Last Thanksgiving night, November 2019, we had been talking about our child. Defandant screamed that I had better do exactly what he said or I would be sorry. He was standing inches away from me and I was backed into the wall of the kitchen. I could feel his spit on my face as he screamed. I was afraid because the last time, about a month before, when he said I better do something or I would be sorry, I did not do what he wanted. So he grabbed me and shook me really hard. This time I was really afraid he would do it again. I ducked under his arms and ran out of the house.
