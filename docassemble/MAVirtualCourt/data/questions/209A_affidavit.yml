question: |
  Your Affidavit
subquestion: |
  Show the judge you need this restraining order to help you be safe.
  
  In your own words, give enough details about the abuse so the judge has a picture in their mind. Your description is your "affidavit."
  
  You should know that if the court does not "{impound}" your affidavit, your words will be public record. It is not easy, but if someone wants to go into court to find and read your affidavit, they can.
  
  Later, you will get a chance to ask the court to {impound} your affidavit.

terms:
  - impound: |
      "Impound" means the court will only let a few special people, like the judge, see a document. Anyone else must file a motion to ask for and give a very good reason for why they need to see the document. You use a Motion for Impoundment to tell the court it would be very dangerous for anyone else to see your affidavit. You will get a chance to include this motion in the forms you send to the court.

  Explain to the judge why you need a restraining order  
subquestion: |
  In your affidavit, do your best to describe the times that ${other_parties.familiar()} abused you. What did ${other_parties.familiar()} say and do?
  
  Write about times that ${other_parties.familiar()}:
  
  * abused you, or
  * did something that made you afraid you were about to be seriously physically harmed.
  Include information about injuries, medical treatment or dental treatment you needed, destruction of property, or sometimes, the police.
  % if plaintiff_has_minor_children:
  
  * The judge should also know about:
  
      * Times ${other_parties.familiar()} abused your ${children.as_noun()},
      * Where your ${children.as_noun()} ${children.did_verb('was')} when ${other_parties.familiar()} was abusing you,
      * Times your ${children.as_noun()} witnessed ${other_parties.familiar()} abusing you, and

subquestion: |
  Writing your affidavit can be hard for all kinds of reasons. Remember you can always call a domestic violence advocate for help. [Safelink](https://www.casamyrna.org/get-support/safelink): ${tel("1-877-785-2020")}.

  Finally, as you write your affidavit, keep in mind that when you sign your name at the end of this guide, you are declaring, “{under penalty of perjury}” that your answers to all these questions are {true to the best of your knowledge}.

  1. Start with the most recent abuse first.  
  2. Then tell the judge about other serious incidents, if there are any.   
help:
  label: What should I talk about?
  heading: Is this all?
  content: |
    Tell the judge about any incidents where you or a child were physically harmed, threatened, felt fear, or tried to get help from police. 
    
    Judges often care most about abuse that has happened during the last year.
    
    One serious incident can be enough to get an Order for Protection. But adding more incidents may improve your chances -- especially if you can show a pattern or trend of abuse. 
    
    This is your chance to explain why you need help.
terms:
  - under penalty of perjury: |
      means you swear that what you write is true, as far as you know.  
         
      Swearing "under penalty of perjury" means the court can punish you if what you write is not true to the best of your knowledge.  
      
      The court cannot punish you if you write about things you saw, heard, or felt.  
      The court cannot punish you if you have good reason to believe that what you write is true.
  - true to the best of your knowledge: |
      Something is true "to the best of your knowledge" if you were there and saw, heard, or felt it.  
      Something is true to the best of your knowledge if you have good reason to believe it is true.

#     2 examples to help you understand how to write a good description: 
#     
#     **A poor example:** 
#     
#     We were arguing. ${ other_parties.familiar() } screamed at me and I was afraid. 
#     
#     **A good example:** 
#     
#     Last Thanksgiving night, November 2019, we were talking about our child. Defendant screamed that I had better do exactly what he said or I would be sorry. He was standing inches away from me and I was backed into the wall of the kitchen. I could feel his spit on my face as he screamed. I was afraid because the last time, about a month before, when he said I better do something or I would be sorry, I did not do what he wanted. So he grabbed me and shook me really hard. This time I was really afraid he would do it again. I ducked under his arms and ran out of the house.
