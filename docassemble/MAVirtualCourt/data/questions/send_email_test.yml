question: |
  Testing sending emails and viewing submissions
subquestion: |
  The goal of the interview is to test and verify sending completed interviews, as well as verifying that the submissions can be only viewed by authorized individuals.
  
  You will fill out a few extremely short interviews, which we will then send to an email you have provided us.

question: |
  Where should we send your emails
subquestion: |
  In an actual interview, we would send the email to a court. 
  However, to prevent unnecessary spam, please provide a name and court that we will treat as an actual court.
  
  We will set this fake court as your preferred court. In an actual interview, we would ask you for your preffered court.

  Make sure that you have access to the email you have provided. 
  For best testing, please provide an email that is not the one you are currently using to sign into this account.

  - Fake court name: fake_court_name

  This email does **not** test sending emails.
  Rather, it tests whether or not we are able to save metadata and allow the appropriate users access.

  This test will work best if you have installed the package.
  If you have not, the links provided will **not** work.
