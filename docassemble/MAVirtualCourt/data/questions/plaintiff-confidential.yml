question: |
  Getting and staying in touch with you
subquestion: |
  The next questions ask for your home, work, school, email address and phone numbers. 
  
  The court needs this information to:
  
  * contact you about your case, and
  * make an order that will help keep you as safe as possible.
  
  ${other_parties.familiar()}, ${other_parties.familiar()}’s lawyer, and the public are not allowed to see this information about you.
  
  Only certain **authorized** people can see it. Even then, they must file a Request for Access to Confidential Information form first, to ask the court's permission.
help:
  label: Who is an "authorized" person?
  heading: Authorized people
  content: |
    People who are authorized to see your addresses and phone numbers are people who may need to contact you as part of their job.   
    
    They are the police or other law enforcement officers, prosecutors, victim-witness advocates, domestic violence counselors and sexual assault counselors.  
    
    You can give the court permission to share this contact information also with certain people you trust.
