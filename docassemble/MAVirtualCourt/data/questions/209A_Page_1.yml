question: |
   Ask the court for a 209A Prevention of Abuse Order
subquestion: | 
  **If you are in danger right now, call 911.**
  
  Please make sure you are in a {safe place}.
  
  An Abuse Prevention Order can help protect you from an abusive partner, a family member, or someone in your household. In Massachusetts, we often call this order a {209A restraining order}.
 
    
  If the abusive person does not obey the order, they  “violate” it. It is a crime to violate a 209A restraining order and the police can arrest them. This order can also order the abusive person to do things like pay utility bills or child support.
  
    A restraining order is only a part of your overall safety plan. Speak with a domestic violence advocate for more help with safety planning. Call [Safelink](https://www.casamyrna.org/get-support/safelink): 1-877-785-2020.
terms:
 - 209A restraining order: |
    People call these court orders, "Abuse Prevention Orders","restraining orders", "209A orders" and "protective orders".
    See [How can a 209A order help me?](https://www.masslegalhelp.org/domestic-violence/how-can-209a-help-me)
 - all the forms: |
    See the checklists on MassLegalHelp for a list of the forms you need to ask the court for protection:
    * [Asking for a 209A restraining order](https://www.masslegalhelp.org/domestic-violence/209a-forms-checklist), or

  What to expect
subquestion: |
  When you ask the court for an abuse prevention order, the judge can do 3 things.

  **1.  Deny your request.** Refuse to give you a restraining order. ${other_parties.familiar()} will not get any notice that you asked the court for a restraining order.

  **2. {Make a temporary order}.** The 2nd hearing will be within 10 days of the temporary order. At the 2nd hearing the judge can hear from both you and ${other_parties.familiar()} at the same time.

  **3. {Not make any order}** until they can hear from both you and ${other_parties.familiar()} at the same time.  If the judge decides **not** to make an order and you decide to go to a hearing where the judge can hear from both of you,  ${other_parties.familiar()} will find out you have asked for a restraining order.
  
  Talk to a domestic violence advocate to learn more about what to expect. Call [SafeLink](https://www.casamyrna.org/get-support/safelink): 877-785-2020.

At the 2nd hearing the judge can hear from both you and ${other_parties.familiar()} at the same time.
  Not make any order: |
    The judge may decide not to make an order at the first hearing if they think you will be safe from "immediate danger of abuse" from ${other_parties.familiar()}.  If the judge decides not to make an order and you decide to go to a hearing where the judge can hear from both of you, ${other_parties.familiar()} will find out you have asked for a restraining order.

Comment: |
  This question should probably go in the Affidavit .yml if we decide to KEEP the none of the above option when listing types of abuse.
event: abuse_does_not_qualify
question: |
  In Massachusetts the law about abuse focuses on **physical** abuse. 

  People **can** abuse you emotionally, financially, psychologically, and spiritually, but you can only ask the court for a 209A restraining order if the abusive person:    

  - **hurt** you physically;
  - **tried** to hurt you physically;
  - **made you scared** of getting physically hurt; or
  - **forced you** to have sex or sexual contact, or **made you** have sex or sexual contact by threatening you or making you feel that you have no choice.

   A 209A restraining order is not the only way to stop someone from abusing you. If someone is abusing you in **any** way, speak with a domestic violence advocate for help. They can help you find ways to be safe. Call [SafeLink](https://www.casamyrna.org/get-support/safelink) 877-785-2020.

  There are four courts that you can choose from to get a 209A Restraining order.
  
  1. The Boston Municipal Court or District court may be close to where you live.
  2. There is only one Probate and Family Court and one Superior Court in
  most counties, which may be further away from where you live.
  
  You can get a 209A restraining order at the District Court near where you live or the Probate and Family Court in your county.  If you live in Boston, you can go to the Boston Municipal Court (BMC) near where you live instead of a District Court. You can also go to the Superior Court in your county.  Most people get 209A restraining orders from District Court, BMC, or Probate and Family Court.  Superior Court restraining orders are rare but may be an option when other available courts are closed due to the COVID-19 crisis. 
  
  If you have moved to another town in Massachusetts since the abuse, you can go to the court where you live now or to the court for an address that you had to leave because of the abuse. 
  
  Some things to think about when you are deciding which court is better for you are:  
  
  #### If the other parent wants to visit your child  
  The District Court is not supposed to order visitation between the other parent and your child as part of a 209A case. The Probate and Family Court can order visitation in a 209A case.  If you want to get visitation settled right away, you might want to go to the Probate and Family Court to file for the 209A restraining order. If you do not want the court to decide about visitation, you might want to go to the District Court for your 209A restraining order. 
  
  #### If the person who abused you is facing criminal charges  
  If the person who abused you is facing criminal charges related to the domestic violence, you might want to file for your 209A restraining order at the District or Superior Court where that case is. That way, you may be able to work with the same Victim/Witness Advocate for both cases.

 # You are seeing this screen because the Plaintiff is under 18.  
# subquestion: |
 # Judges and other court employees are called "mandated reporters."  That means that if they think a child under 18 is being abused or neglected, they are supposed to report the case to the Department of Children and Families.  It is possible that this will happen in your case.

#  Since you are under 18, the Department of Children and Families may get involved if you file a restraining order. You can read more about getting a restraining order while you are under 18 at https://www.masslegalhelp.org/domestic-violence/abuse-prevention-orders/under-18.
